# nix-utilities
A Collection of Small Scripts and Command Line Programs for nix-customization

    - `caps2tab`
        - A small script to bind the caps lock key to tab. Useful for people who
          use autocomplete but not caps lock
    -`macmapper`
        - A small script that bind the right alt and right command keys on a
          macbook to the right mouse button for Macbook Linux installations,
          since the 2 finger tap on the trackpad doesn't always work correctly
